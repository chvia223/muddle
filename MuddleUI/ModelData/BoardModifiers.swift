///  spots in the guess are filled. If they are not then the original GameBoard is returned.
///  Otherwise each letter in the guess will be compared against each letter in the solution
///  through a series of loops and the state stored in each guess letter will be modified as each
///  loop checks for.

///  (Commentary)

///  So the last implementation of this code was actually wrong and didn't work right. And on top
///  of all of that it was inefficient for what it was. I can't believe I thought a nested for loop was
///  completely necessary. Though that might be what's happening during that .contains call in the
///  second for loop. Either way, this works much better now and is much less ugly. Like waaaaay
///  less ugly. Thank guard!
